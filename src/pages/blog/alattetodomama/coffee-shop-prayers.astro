      <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8 font-light">
        Let me tell you something: this mama loves coffee. Not just like it. Not just enjoy it. I LOVE coffee.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        And you know what's even better than coffee? Coffee drive-throughs where I don't have to unbuckle two car seats,
        wrangle two little boys through a parking lot, and then wrangle them back into said car seats while my coffee gets cold.
        Girl, the drive-through was invented for moms like us.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">Jefferson City's Newest Blessing: Dutch Bros</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        We just got a <a href="https://www.dutchbros.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-mcgennis-maroon hover:text-mcgennis-gold transition-colors underline">Dutch Bros</a> here in Jefferson City, and can I just say—it's a game changer. Don't get me wrong,
        7brew and i have had an expensive love affair. But they started making their drinks too sweet. I love sweet AND strong coffee.
        Dutch Bros gets it right. The perfect balance. The perfect sweetness.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        And before you judge my coffee spending, let me introduce you to a little concept called "girl math." If I make
        coffee at home four days a week, then treating myself to Dutch Bros on Friday is basically free. See? Free coffee.
        You're welcome for the financial wisdom.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">Coffee: My Daily Kickstart</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Here's the thing about coffee for me—it's not just caffeine (though let's be honest, with Leonardo and Raphael,
        I need all the help I can get). Coffee is my ritual. My transition. My moment of "okay, Stephanie, time to do this thing."
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Whether I'm pulling through Dutch Bros on the way to MOPS or making a cup at home before my Bible time, that first
        sip is like a reset button. It's the moment when I shift from survival mode to actually being present. From "get
        the kids dressed, where are the shoes, why is there yogurt on the ceiling" to "okay, God, I'm here. Let's do this day together."
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">The Drive-Thru as Sacred Space</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I know it sounds silly, but some of my best prayers happen in the drive-through line. While I'm waiting for my
        Caramelizer (if you know, you know), I'm talking to God. Not the pretty prayers I'd say in church. The real ones.
      </p>

      <div class="bg-white border-l-4 border-mcgennis-maroon p-6 my-8 rounded-r-lg">
        <p class="text-gray-700 italic">
          "God, I'm so tired. Give me patience for the tantrums today. Help me be kind to Caleb even though he worked
          until midnight and I'm running on three hours of sleep. Remind me that these are the good old days, even when
          Leonardo is asking 'why' for the 47th time before 9 AM."
        </p>
      </div>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        There's something about being in the car, kids strapped in, music playing softly, waiting in line—it's like God
        carved out this little pocket of space just for us to chat. No distractions. No phone. Just me, my steering wheel,
        and the God who sees this tired mama and loves her anyway. (Even when dealing with <a href="/blog/alattetodomama/fall-allergies-and-prayer" class="text-mcgennis-maroon hover:text-mcgennis-gold transition-colors underline">health challenges and finding peace in chaos</a>.)
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">Bible Time & Coffee: The Perfect Pairing</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        On the mornings when I make coffee at home—usually my trusty French press because it makes me feel fancy even in
        my Target pajamas—it's the prelude to my Bible time. I've learned that if I don't spend time with God before the
        chaos hits, I'm not the mom I want to be. Caleb's <a href="/blog/entrepreneur-ai/church-and-business-overlap" class="text-mcgennis-maroon hover:text-mcgennis-gold transition-colors underline">work in ministry and business</a> keeps us connected to <a href="/blog/entrepreneur-ai/best-churches-jefferson-city-missouri" class="text-mcgennis-maroon hover:text-mcgennis-gold transition-colors underline">Jefferson City's amazing faith community</a>, which reminds me daily of the importance of staying grounded in faith.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Coffee warms my hands. Scripture warms my heart. It's that simple and that profound.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Some days it's just one verse and three sips before someone needs me. Other days I get twenty minutes of peace,
        my Bible app open, my coffee still hot, and the house still quiet. Those mornings? Those are the ones that carry
        me through the hard afternoons.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">The Theology of Small Rewards</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I used to feel guilty about spending money on coffee. Like I should be more responsible, more frugal, more...
        something. But you know what? God invented coffee beans. He created taste buds. He gave us the ability to enjoy
        good things. And I think He smiles when we receive those gifts with gratitude.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        My Dutch Bros runs aren't frivolous. They're tiny acts of self-care that help me be a better mom, a better wife,
        a better version of myself. And in a season of life where I'm touched out, talked out, and running on fumes more
        often than I'd like to admit—that $6 iced coffee is worth every penny.
      </p>

      <div class="bg-white border-l-4 border-mcgennis-maroon p-6 my-8 rounded-r-lg">
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-medium mb-2">My Coffee Philosophy (A Latte to Do Mama Style):</p>
        <ul class="text-gray-600 space-y-2 list-disc list-inside">
          <li>Coffee at home = quality time with God</li>
          <li>Drive-through coffee = mobile prayer closet</li>
          <li>Good coffee = God's gift to tired mamas</li>
          <li>Girl math = legitimate financial strategy (don't @ me)</li>
          <li>Dutch Bros > 7 Brew (I said what I said)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">Finding God in the Everyday</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Here's what I've learned: God doesn't just show up in the quiet, perfect moments. He shows up in the drive-through
        line with two kids in the backseat arguing about who saw the fire truck first. He shows up in the early morning
        darkness when I'm desperately making coffee before anyone else wakes up. He shows up in the mundane, the messy,
        the ordinary.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Maybe your thing isn't coffee. Maybe it's tea, or a morning walk, or those five minutes in the shower before
        everyone needs something. Whatever it is, I hope you give yourself permission to have it. To enjoy it. To let it
        be the rhythm that helps you breathe.

      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        And if you're in Jefferson City and you see a tired-looking mama in the Dutch Bros drive-through at 7:30 AM with
        two little boys in the back, that's probably me. Wave if you want. Or better yet—say a quick prayer for me.
        I promise I'll be doing the same for you.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed font-medium">
        Because we're all just doing our best, one coffee at a time.
