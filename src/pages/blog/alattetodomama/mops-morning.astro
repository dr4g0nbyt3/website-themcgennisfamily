              I'm blessed to stay home with my baby. It's just he and I right now. He turned 1 almost a month ago. This is the cute little package I got ready for him last night (v. last minute unsurprisingly) to take to MOPS with us this morning like the instructions said on Facebook.

              My excitement only bubbled over when I walked inside and saw familiar faces, an iced coffee station, breakfast pizza, and the cutest decorations. I put on a name tag and walked to drop my 13mo baby off in the nursery.
