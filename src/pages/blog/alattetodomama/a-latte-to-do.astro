              I've been considering this for a while but I'm not sure. Do people still blog? If they do, do other people still read it? Is this market way over saturated AND outdated? I guess we'll see.

            </div>

            <p>
              I've included this picture as my inspiration and a working title for my new blogging persona. A super cute coffee cup to do list with checkboxes that says "a latte to do." So shoutout Walmart I clearly didn't come up with this name but I think that's fine.
            </p>

            <p>
              My first thoughts when glancing at such a notepad are usually oh that's so cute, but that's not anywhere close to enough boxes or lines for the kind of lists I write. And clearly this isn't your typical self-help, get organized and mentally healthy blog. Because if I knew how to do that, I'd be able to make smaller lists and accomplish a lot more tasks in the time I plan to.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is going to be real stuff, that's hopefully relatable, occasionally helpful, and always pointing you towards God's love and mercy.
            </p>

            <p>
              I saw this to do list notepad at around 10pm at my local Walmart where I had run after my baby (almost 13mo) had gone to sleep because it was about to be a very busy week but I had ignored the fact that I was out of diapers and needed some things the very next morning because it was the first day of MOPS for the Fall!
            </p>

            <p>
              As if that wouldn't be enough to fill our day, we had my son's 1yr doctor's appointment in the afternoon. So as I had recently designated Tuesdays to be my shopping day in an effort to stay on budget. I knew I needed to get that done ahead of time. But I ignored this fact because it was Labor Day and we got invited to do things (eat and have our baby entertained by other people) all day.
