          There's a place on the eastern coast of Ireland, nestled between the Mourne Mountains and the Irish Sea, where my family ruled for centuries. A place I've never been, but that calls to me with every discovery I make about our heritage.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
          County Down, Ulster—the ancient territory of Iveagh. This is where the Mag Aonghusa clan built their seat of power, defended their lands, and shaped Irish history for nearly 500 years. This is where castles still stand (or at least their ruins do), where stones remember coronations, and where the landscape itself tells the story of our ancestors.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
          I'm writing this travel guide as much for myself as for anyone else. One day, I want to take this journey. I want to walk the same hills the Lords of Iveagh walked, stand in the ruins of Dundrum Castle, touch the inauguration stone at Rathfriland. And when I do, I'll bring this guide with me—a roadmap to connect 875 years of history to one week in modern Ireland.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
          If you're a McGennis, MacGuinness, Maguinness, or Guinness descendant—or if you're just fascinated by Irish history—this guide will show you how to explore our ancestral homeland and experience the places that shaped our family legacy.

          The territory of Iveagh, our ancestral homeland, encompasses much of southern County Down. The name "Iveagh" (Irish: <em>Uíbh Eachach</em>) still appears in modern place names, business names, and local geography—a constant reminder of the territory the Mag Aonghusa clan once ruled.

          This itinerary covers all the major McGennis ancestral sites in County Down. You could rush through in 2-3 days, but I recommend taking a full week to really experience each location, explore the surrounding areas, and let the history sink in.

        <!-- Day 1-2: Rathfriland -->

            <h3 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-2">Days 1-2: Rathfriland - The Seat of Power</h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-100">The ceremonial capital of the Lords of Iveagh</p>
          </div>

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              <strong>Rathfriland</strong> (Irish: <em>Ráth Fraoileann</em>, meaning "fort of Fraoileann") was the seat of power for the Mag Aonghusa clan. This hilltop town served as the ceremonial and administrative center of Iveagh for centuries.
            </p>

            <h4 class="font-bold text-mcgennis-navy mb-3 mt-6">What to See:</h4>

                <span class="text-mcgennis-gold mr-2">★</span>
                <div>
                  <strong>The Inauguration Stone Chair:</strong> The most important artifact in Rathfriland. This ancient stone chair was used for the ceremonial inauguration of the Lords of Iveagh. When a new Mag Aonghusa lord came to power, he would be seated on this stone in a ceremony that legitimized his rule. The stone represents the unbroken line of our family's leadership.
                </div>
              </li>
              <li class="flex items-start">

                <div>
                  <strong>The Hilltop Position:</strong> Walk to the high points of Rathfriland and look out over the valley. This is the strategic vantage point our ancestors chose for their capital—you can see for miles in every direction, perfect for spotting approaching threats.
                </div>
              </li>

                <div>
                  <strong>St. Patrick's Church:</strong> While not from the medieval period, this church and cemetery contain layers of local history and may have connections to earlier religious sites on the same ground.

              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 italic">
                Stand at the inauguration stone and imagine the ceremony: drums, torches, the gathered clan, and your ancestor taking his seat as the rightful Lord of Iveagh. This stone has witnessed our family's power, pride, and purpose for centuries. Touch it. Feel the connection.

Built by Norman invader John de Courcy in 1177, this massive stone fortress was constructed on the edge of Mag Aonghusa territory as a statement of Norman power and a threat to our clan's independence.
            </p>

            <h4 class="font-bold text-mcgennis-maroon mb-3 mt-6">What to See:</h4>

                <span class="text-mcgennis-gold mr-2">★</span>
                <div>
                  <strong>The Castle Ruins:</strong> The substantial remains include the circular keep, curtain walls, and gatehouse. Climb to the top of the keep for panoramic views of the bay and surrounding countryside—you'll understand immediately why de Courcy chose this location.

                <div>
                  <strong>The Strategic Position:</strong> The castle overlooks the sea approach to Iveagh territory. From here, Norman forces could monitor coastal traffic and project power into the heart of Mag Aonghusa lands.
                </div>
              </li>

                  <strong>The Coastal Views:</strong> On a clear day, you can see across Dundrum Bay to the Mourne Mountains. The natural beauty contrasts sharply with the fortress's military purpose.

              <h4 class="font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2">Historical Context:</h4>
              <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
                For the Mag Aonghusa clan, Dundrum Castle represented the beginning of centuries of pressure from external powers. The Normans built it to intimidate and control; our ancestors would have seen it as a constant reminder that their traditional authority was being challenged. Standing in these ruins, you're at a pivot point in our family's history—the moment when the old Gaelic order began to face the reality of conquest.
              </p>
            </div>

              <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Small car park at the base of the hill; short steep walk to castle</li>

              <strong>Knock Iveagh</strong> (from Irish <em>Cnoc Uíbh Eachach</em>, meaning "Hill of Iveagh") is both a place name and a powerful symbol. This prominent hill served as a strategic lookout point and territorial marker for the Mag Aonghusa lordship.

                  <strong>Narrow Water Castle:</strong> A 16th-century tower house on the shores of Carlingford Lough. While built after the height of Mag Aonghusa power, it represents the continued importance of this coastal region and the evolution of Irish defensive architecture.

                  <strong>The Warrenpoint Coronation Stone:</strong> Similar to the Rathfriland inauguration chair, this stone was used in ceremonies legitimizing the rule of the Lords of Iveagh.

                  <strong>Slieve Donard:</strong> At 850 meters, the highest peak in the Mournes and in Northern Ireland. A challenging but rewarding hike with incredible views. Our ancestors would have known these mountains intimately—as natural barriers, hunting grounds, and refuges.

          This isn't just tourism. This is pilgrimage. You're not visiting Ireland—you're returning home to a place your ancestors left generations ago.

          <ul class="space-y-3 text-gray-100">
            <li><strong>Bring Family:</strong> If possible, make this a multi-generational journey. Let your children touch the inauguration stone, climb the castle walls, see the landscape their ancestors shaped.</li>
            <li><strong>Journal:</strong> Write about what you feel at each site. The emotions, the connections, the sense of belonging. These notes will become precious.</li>
            <li><strong>Photography:</strong> Document everything, but also put the camera down sometimes and just be present.</li>
            <li><strong>Research Beforehand:</strong> Read the heritage post about our family history before you go. Knowing the stories makes the sites come alive.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Connections:</strong> Visit pubs, talk to locals, mention your surname. You might find distant cousins or people who know the family history.</li>
            <li><strong>Slow Down:</strong> Don't rush. Spend extra time at places that move you. This is about connection, not checking boxes.</li>

          I'm planning to bring Leonardo and Raphael on this journey one day—maybe when they're teenagers, old enough to appreciate the weight of it. I want them to stand where their ancestors stood, to feel that tangible connection to 875 years of family history. I want them to touch the inauguration stone and understand that leadership, responsibility, and service run in their blood.

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-100">
            County Down is more than a destination on a map. It's the landscape that shaped our family, the ground our ancestors walked, fought, ruled, and eventually left. Every stone, every hill, every ruined castle wall connects us to that heritage.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-100">
            Whether you make this journey next year or ten years from now, whether you go alone or with family, you'll be walking in the footsteps of the Lords of Iveagh. You'll stand where they stood, see what they saw, and feel the weight and wonder of 875 years of family history.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-100">
            <em>Sola Salus Servire Deo</em> - In the Service of God. Our ancestors lived by this motto in these hills. We can honor that legacy by making the pilgrimage home.
