          There's something profound about discovering that your family name isn't just a collection of letters on a birth certificate—it's a living thread connecting you to warriors, lords, and a people who shaped the very landscape of Ireland nearly 900 years ago.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
          As I sit here in Jefferson City, Missouri, watching Leonardo and Raphael play in our backyard, I'm struck by the weight of what I've discovered about our family heritage. The McGennis name—our name—traces back to 1150 AD in County Down, Ulster, Ireland. We weren't just Irish. We were <strong>Lords of Iveagh</strong>, rulers of a territory that would shape Irish history for centuries.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
          This isn't just genealogy research or ancestry.com profiles. This is about understanding who we are, where we came from, and why our family motto—<em>"Sola Salus Servire Deo"</em> (In the Service of God)—resonates so deeply with the values Stephanie and I are building our family upon.
        </p>

      <!-- The Name -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-display font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">The Name: Mag Aonghusa - "Son of Unique Choice"</h2>
        <div class="h-1 w-16 bg-brass-horizontal rounded-full shadow-sm mb-6"></div>

        <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Our original Gaelic name was <strong>Mag Aonghusa</strong>, which translates to "son of unique choice." In the ancient Irish naming tradition, this wasn't just a descriptor—it was a declaration of identity and purpose.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-gray-50 border-l-4 border-mcgennis-navy p-6 my-8 rounded-r-xl">
          <p class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900 mb-2">Etymology:</p>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
            <li><strong>Mag</strong> = "son of" (Irish patronymic prefix)</li>
            <li><strong>Aonghus</strong> = "unique choice"</li>
            <li>Sometimes written as <strong>Maguinness</strong> or <strong>MacGuinness</strong> in anglicized forms</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The name evolved through the centuries as English influence spread across Ireland. Mag Aonghusa became Maguinness, then MacGuinness, and eventually McGennis in various family branches. Each variation tells part of the story of Irish resistance, adaptation, and survival through centuries of conflict and change.
        </p>

        <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
          What strikes me most is the meaning: <em>"unique choice."</em> As an entrepreneur building multiple businesses—BXP, The Honey Homestead, Nostalgia Nuke, LoHP—I see that same drive in myself. The ability to make unique choices, to chart our own path. The same trait that made our ancestors effective lords and leaders.

      <!-- Lords of Iveagh -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-display font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Lords of Iveagh: Rulers of County Down</h2>
        <div class="h-1 w-16 bg-brass-horizontal rounded-full shadow-sm mb-6"></div>

        <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
          From 1150 onwards, the Mag Aonghusa clan held dominion over <strong>Iveagh</strong> (Irish: <em>Uíbh Eachach</em>), a territory in what is now County Down in Ulster, Northern Ireland. We weren't minor chieftains or distant relatives of nobility—we were the ruling lords.
        </p>

        <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The territory of Iveagh stretched across some of the most strategic and beautiful lands in Ulster, from the Mourne Mountains to the shores of Lough Neagh. Our ancestors built their seat of power at <strong>Rathfriland</strong> (Irish: <em>Ráth Fraoileann</em>, meaning "fort of Fraoileann"), a hilltop fortification that would serve as the ceremonial and administrative center of our clan for generations.
        </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-mcgennis-navy mb-4">The Iveagh Territory</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Our ancestral lands included:</p>
          <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700 list-disc list-inside">
            <li><strong>Rathfriland</strong> - The seat of power and ceremonial capital</li>
            <li><strong>Knock Iveagh</strong> - Strategic hillfort overlooking the territory</li>
            <li><strong>Dundrum</strong> - Coastal stronghold with commanding castle</li>
            <li><strong>The Mourne Mountains</strong> - Natural fortress and resource-rich highlands</li>
            <li><strong>Rich farmlands</strong> - Supporting a prosperous clan economy</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
          As Lords of Iveagh, the Mag Aonghusa clan held significant political and military power in Ulster. We formed alliances, defended our territory from Norman invaders, and maintained the Gaelic traditions and laws that had governed Ireland for millennia. Our influence extended beyond our immediate territory—we were key players in the complex web of Irish clan politics.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
              The Mag Aonghusa clan emerges as the established Lords of Iveagh in County Down, Ulster. This is pre-Norman Ireland, a time when Gaelic clan structure dominated Irish society and politics. Our ancestors ruled from Rathfriland, maintaining law, defending territory, and preserving Irish culture.

              The Normans, led by John de Courcy, invade Ulster and begin the systematic conquest of Irish territories. The Mag Aonghusa clan faces its first major external threat. De Courcy builds Dundrum Castle on the coast of our territory—a massive stone fortress designed to project Norman power into the heart of Iveagh.

              For centuries, the Mag Aonghusa clan navigates the complex politics of Norman-controlled Ireland while maintaining our Gaelic identity and lordship. We resist, we negotiate, we adapt. Our territory contracts and expands with the fortunes of war and diplomacy, but we remain Lords of Iveagh.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
              The systematic English conquest of Ireland under the Tudor monarchs brings unprecedented pressure. The old Gaelic order is systematically dismantled. Many Irish lords lose their lands, their titles, and their power. The Mag Aonghusa clan, like many Irish families, faces a choice: submit to English rule or lose everything.

              The systematic plantation of Ulster with Scottish and English settlers fundamentally changes the demographic and political landscape. Many Gaelic families are displaced from their ancestral lands. The name begins its anglicization—Mag Aonghusa becomes Maguinness, MacGuinness, and eventually McGennis in various branches.

              The Great Famine (1845-1852) and subsequent economic hardship drive massive Irish emigration. McGennis families scatter to America, Canada, Australia, and beyond. Our family joins millions of Irish seeking opportunity in the New World, carrying with them memories of County Down and the legacy of the Lords of Iveagh.

        <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-display font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">The Guinness Connection: Shared Roots</h2>
        <div class="h-1 w-16 bg-brass-horizontal rounded-full shadow-sm mb-6"></div>

        <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Here's something that surprised me when I discovered it: the McGennis clan and the Guinness family share the same ancestral roots. We're both descended from the <strong>Mag Aonghusa</strong> clan of Iveagh.
        </p>

        <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The Guinness family represents one branch of the clan that anglicized the name differently—Mag Aonghusa became Guinness rather than McGennis or MacGuinness. When Arthur Guinness founded his famous brewery in Dublin in 1759, he carried with him the same clan heritage we share.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-brass-button brightness-110 text-white rounded-xl p-8 my-8">
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Shared Heritage, Different Paths</h3>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Both families descend from the Lords of Iveagh in County Down. Both carry the legacy of Mag Aonghusa—"son of one strength." The Guinness family built a brewing empire that became synonymous with Ireland itself. Our branch of the family traveled a different path, eventually to America, to Missouri, to Jefferson City.
          </p>
          <p class="italic text-gray-300">
            Same roots, different expressions of that "one strength" that defines our heritage.

        </div>

        <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
          I find it fascinating that both branches of the family tree exemplify entrepreneurship and building something lasting. Whether it's brewing beer or building businesses in Jefferson City, that drive to create, to build, to leave a legacy—it seems to run in the bloodline.

        <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
          This Latin motto encapsulates the deepest values of our family heritage. Through centuries of conquest, displacement, famine, and emigration, the Mag Aonghusa/McGennis family maintained their Catholic faith and the conviction that true purpose comes from serving God.
        </p>

        <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
          When I think about my work with Sports Crusaders ministry, my previous years with the Missouri Baptist Convention and Concord Baptist Church, this motto suddenly makes perfect sense. It's not just words on a coat of arms—it's a value system passed down through 875 years of family history.
        </p>

        <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Stephanie and I are raising Leonardo and Raphael with these same values. The businesses we build, the community we serve in Jefferson City, the faith we practice—all of it flows from this central truth that our ancestors understood: the only salvation is in serving God.

          Discovering this heritage isn't about living in the past or claiming some kind of inherited superiority. It's about understanding the thread that connects us across centuries and continents.
        </p>

        <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
          When I look at Leonardo and Raphael, I see the latest link in an unbroken chain stretching back to 1150 AD. They carry the same DNA as the Lords of Iveagh who defended their territory from Rathfriland. They inherit the same entrepreneurial drive that built kingdoms and businesses. They're being raised with the same faith that sustained our family through conquest, famine, and diaspora.

        <p class="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The Lords of Iveagh are gone. The territory is now part of modern Northern Ireland. The castles are ruins, and the ancient Gaelic world has long since passed.
