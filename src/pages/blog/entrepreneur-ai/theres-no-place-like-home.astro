        Sometimes the journey home is longer and more painful than you ever imagined. But home is still there, waiting.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">The Morning</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I was fifteen when I woke up to see my grandma—Nene—at my house. She wasn't supposed to be there. Not that early.
        Not unannounced.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Something was in the air that morning. A slight eerie dread. The kind you feel before you know why you feel it.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        That's when we got the call.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Brian is at the hospital.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        A million questions ran through my head. But deep down, I knew. I knew my dad was most likely gone.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">The Hospital</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        When we got to the hospital, my dad lay there in a coma. The doctors explained what we now know was an overdose
        death due to asphyxiation. But the public relations side of my mom came out. We settled on "heart attack" or
        "heart failure" for everyone else. Easier to explain. Easier to accept.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        After a week of praying to God—asking why, begging for answers—I was at a loss. Family members came and went.
        The hospital room filled with prayers and tears and silence.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Then the doctor approached my mom.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        "If we are going to harvest the organs, we need to do so soon."
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        All because he had checked "donate organs" on his driver's license.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I made a decision right then and there. When I get a driver's license, I will <em>not</em> check that box. And I
        won't let anyone else in my family check that box either.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I couldn't go through this again.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">Lost</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        After my dad died, my sense of direction was lost. I lost my guide in life. The person who was supposed to show
        me how to be a man, how to navigate the world, how to make decisions—gone.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I dropped out of college. Moved to South Carolina. Ran from everything that reminded me of home.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Until…
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">The Dream</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        My mom called me one day out of the blue.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        "Is everything okay?" she asked.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        "Yeah," I said, confused. "Why?"
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        "I had a dream that someone in my life was in a huge accident."
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I brushed it off. Just a dream. Nothing to worry about.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">The Wreck</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        My step-dad and grandpa were in a wreck.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I received a call from my mom saying that John Abbott, my step-dad, had been in an accident. Shortly after, my
        sister sent me a bunch of gruesome pictures of him in the hospital. I couldn't even stomach looking at them. I
        deleted them off my phone immediately.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        As my heart sank, I called my mom and asked for the details.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        John had taken my grandpa, Mark, up in an old World War II plane for Father's Day. A gift. A memory. An experience
        they'd never forget.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        They got more than they bargained for.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Neither of them remember much of the crash. But they tried to piece together the details they did remember. The
        wings that hold the fuel had been ripped off by the trees. One wing had been caught on a telephone wire, dramatically
        slowing the aircraft down just enough to keep them alive.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        They stumbled out of the aircraft as quickly as they could—trying not to be burned alive in a gulf of flames. John
        was coughing up blood. They were rushed to the hospital.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">Airway, Airway, Airway</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        After one night in the hospital, John was throwing up through his wired-shut mouth. A doctor or nurse was reading
        off his vitals, not realizing the danger.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        That's when John's dad—previously an EMT—started yelling: "Airway! Airway! Airway!"
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        He rolled John to his side to prevent…
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Asphyxiation.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The same way my dad died.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        In a playfully serious manner, we sometimes make the joke to my mom: "The men you marry aren't safe."
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        But it's not really a joke. It's trauma wrapped in humor because we don't know how else to process it.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">Coming Home</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        After that, I moved back to Missouri. I got a job at Chipotle. I started attending Freshwater Life Group with a
        buddy of mine, Josh Herrick.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        That's where I met Mitch Canote, the media director for Freshwater. One day, he invited me to Mod Pizza to discuss
        an internship for the <a href="https://mobaptist.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-mcgennis-navy hover:text-mcgennis-gold transition-colors underline">Missouri Baptist Convention</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        We sat there eating pizza, and I shared my passion with him. How interested I was in music, audio, technology. How
        much I loved using media to serve people and advance the Gospel.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        He basically said, "You got it."
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I filled out some paperwork. Gave my testimony. And just like that, I was off to FILO—an audio and video conference
        called First In Last Out—as an intern for the Missouri Baptist Convention.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        My new home.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I was confused. Was it this simple? After all the loss, all the trauma, all the running away—was it really this
        easy to find my way back?
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        It really was as easy as clicking my heels.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">There's No Place Like Home</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Dorothy was right. There's no place like home.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        But sometimes you have to go through the tornado. You have to walk the yellow brick road. You have to face the
        witches and the flying monkeys and the Wizard who turns out to be just a man behind a curtain.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Sometimes you have to lose your dad at fifteen. Watch your step-dad nearly die the same way. Drop out of college.
        Move to another state. Work at Chipotle. Feel completely lost and directionless.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        And then one day, someone invites you to Mod Pizza and says, "You got it."
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        And you realize home was there all along. You just had to find your way back.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The Missouri Baptist Convention became my home. Not because it was a building or a job or an organization. But
        because it was where God called me. Where my gifts were recognized. Where my passion found purpose. Where I
        discovered that even after all the loss and trauma, there was still a place for me.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I think about my dad sometimes. About the driver's license. About the organs. About the choice I made to never
        check that box.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I think about my step-dad. About the plane crash. About the word "airway" screamed three times by someone who
        knew exactly what was at stake.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I think about my mom's dream. A warning from God that we didn't fully understand until it was too late to prevent
        but just in time to survive.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        And I think about home. About how sometimes the longest journey is the one that brings you back to where you
        started. About how God uses loss and pain and trauma to shape us into who we're meant to be.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-xl font-medium text-gray-900">
        There's no place like home. But the journey to get there? That's where you find out who you really are.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-xl font-medium text-gray-900">
        And sometimes, it really is as easy as clicking your heels. You just have to be ready to walk the road first.
