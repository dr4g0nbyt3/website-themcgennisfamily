        Sometimes the biggest opportunities in life come from the most casual conversations.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">The Casual Mention</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I was working at the Missouri Baptist Convention when my boss, Chris Brizendine, casually mentioned something
        in passing. You know how those conversations go—not a formal meeting, not a big announcement, just a casual
        mention during the workday.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        "Hey, Tricia from <a href="https://sportscrusaders.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-mcgennis-navy hover:text-mcgennis-gold transition-colors underline">Sports Crusaders</a> is looking for someone to start an esports ministry."
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        That's it. That's all he said. But something clicked in my mind immediately. Esports? Ministry? Those were
        two worlds I lived in—gaming and faith. I'd been a gamer for years. I understood the culture, the community,
        the potential. And I was passionate about ministry and reaching people with the Gospel.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The wheels started turning. This wasn't just an opportunity. This felt like a calling.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">The First Encounter</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Fast forward to 2020. The <a href="https://mobaptist.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-mcgennis-navy hover:text-mcgennis-gold transition-colors underline">Missouri Baptist Convention</a> annual meeting was in full swing. If you've ever been
        to an annual meeting, you know it's organized chaos—hundreds of people, dozens of conversations, networking,
        workshops, worship, business sessions. It's a lot.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        And in the middle of all that chaos, I saw her. Tricia. The woman who was looking for someone to run esports.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I didn't hesitate. I walked right up to her.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        "I hear you're looking for someone to run esports."
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        She looked at me, probably a little surprised by the direct approach.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-xl font-medium text-mcgennis-navy">
        "I'm your guy."
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        That was it. Bold. Confident. Maybe a little presumptuous. But I meant it.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Of course, annual meeting being annual meeting, we didn't get much more into the conversation. There were
        sessions to attend, people to meet, business to handle. We exchanged pleasantries and moved on. But I knew
        I'd planted a seed.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">The Second Encounter</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The next time I saw Tricia, I was helping set up the conference room for <a href="https://sportscrusaders.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-mcgennis-navy hover:text-mcgennis-gold transition-colors underline">Sports Crusaders</a>. Tables, chairs,
        audio equipment—the usual event setup. I was happy to serve wherever needed.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        And there she was again.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I looked at her, smiled, and said it again:
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-xl font-medium text-mcgennis-navy">
        "I'm your guy."
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        If she thought I was persistent before, now she knew I was serious. This wasn't just a casual interest.
        I wasn't just making conversation at an annual meeting. I genuinely believed God was calling me to this.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">The Prayer</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Here's what I didn't know at the time.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Tricia had been praying about starting an esports ministry. She saw the potential. She understood that gaming
        was where young people were spending their time, where communities were being built, where conversations were
        happening. She knew esports could be a powerful tool for ministry.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        But she also knew her limitations.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        So she prayed with one condition: <em>God, send me someone to run it, because heaven knows I wouldn't be able to.</em>
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        She didn't want to force it. She didn't want to launch something she couldn't sustain. She wanted God to send
        the right person—someone who understood gaming, who had the passion, who could build something lasting.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        And then I walked up to her twice and said, "I'm your guy."
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">Divine Appointments</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Looking back, I can see God's hand in every step of this story.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        A casual mention from my boss. A divine appointment at an annual meeting. A second encounter while setting up
        chairs. And behind it all, a woman praying for God to send someone.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I didn't know Tricia was praying. She didn't know I was the answer to her prayer. But God knew. And He
        orchestrated the whole thing. Today, I use tools like <a href="https://claude.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-mcgennis-navy hover:text-mcgennis-gold transition-colors underline">Claude.ai</a> to help build ministry technology—understanding <a href="/blog/entrepreneur-ai/ai-hallucinations-explained" class="text-mcgennis-navy hover:text-mcgennis-gold transition-colors underline">AI limitations</a> and using <a href="/blog/entrepreneur-ai/the-magic-words-ai-prompting" class="text-mcgennis-navy hover:text-mcgennis-gold transition-colors underline">effective prompting</a> to create tools that serve the ministry God called me to.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        That's how God works. He uses casual conversations. He uses bold declarations. He uses conference room setups.
        He uses prayers and persistence. And somehow, in the middle of all the chaos and noise of life, He brings the
        right people together at exactly the right time.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">The Lesson</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        If you're waiting for God to open doors, be ready to walk through them boldly. Don't assume someone else will
        step up. Don't wait for the perfect moment. When you feel that nudge, when you see that opportunity, when you
        know in your gut that this is where God is calling you—be bold enough to say, "I'm your guy." If you're looking for a church community that supports this kind of faith-driven calling, check out <a href="/blog/entrepreneur-ai/best-churches-jefferson-city-missouri" class="text-mcgennis-navy hover:text-mcgennis-gold transition-colors underline">Jefferson City's vibrant faith community</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        And if you're praying for God to send someone, be ready to recognize them when they show up. Sometimes the
        answer to your prayer walks right up to you and introduces themselves. Twice.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        God orchestrates divine appointments every single day. Our job is to pay attention, be bold, and trust that
        He's working behind the scenes in ways we can't even see.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-xl font-medium text-gray-900">
        Because sometimes, the biggest opportunities in life really do come from the most casual conversations.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        And sometimes, all you need to say is: "I'm your guy."
