        They say God can move mountains. But sometimes He doesn't just move them. He chews them up and spits them out.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">The Mountain</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        After arriving at <a href="https://www.concordjc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-mcgennis-navy hover:text-mcgennis-gold transition-colors underline">Concord Baptist Church</a> as the new Media Director, I immediately ran into struggles. The kind
        that make you question if you made the right decision. The kind that make you wonder if this mountain is too
        big to climb.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The media team had been slowly leaving over time. Morale was low. Trust was broken. And the previous Media
        Director had been asked to step down—which was the final straw for many. I walked into a situation that most
        people would have walked right back out of.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I had a tough mountain in front of me.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">Philip's Stand</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        But I wasn't alone. Philip—one of the guys on the team—stood up for me from day one.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I remember him talking to Rick, one of the key leaders at the church. Philip looked him in the eye and said,
        "This guy is a good guy. He will take good care of us."
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Later, Philip pulled me aside and told me something that I'll never forget. He said the only reason he stayed
        at Concord was because he heard I was coming.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        That meant more to me than he probably realized. In a moment when everything felt uncertain, when the mountain
        felt insurmountable, someone believed in me. Someone stayed because of me. Someone was willing to give me a
        chance.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">The Red Flag</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        My first conversation with Rick was pleasant enough. But there was a red flag. A big one.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I remember Rick's words like they were yesterday. Words that defied every part of who I am as an entrepreneur
        and innovator:
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 italic text-xl text-center text-gray-900">
        "We've been doing it this way for 20 years. Why change?"
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I smiled and waved in an understanding manner. Nodded politely. But in my head, I was thinking, <em>I would
        change my entire process to save myself 20 seconds.</em>
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        As I went home that day, I wrestled with this concept. How do you bring innovation to a place that's been doing
        things the same way for two decades? How do you move forward when the culture is built on "we've always done it
        this way"?
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I didn't have an answer. Not yet.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">The Hy-Vee Moment</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The next day, I was at the <a href="https://www.hy-vee.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-mcgennis-navy hover:text-mcgennis-gold transition-colors underline">Hy-Vee</a> restaurant. Just grabbing some food, minding my business. And who do I see
        walk in? Rick. And his buddy.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <em>No way,</em> I thought to myself. What are the odds?
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I walked over, said hi, made some playful banter about the Kansas City Royals hat Rick had on. We chatted for
        a minute, and then they left. Just a random, casual encounter at a grocery store restaurant.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Except it wasn't.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        A few minutes after they left, I noticed an over-the-shoulder bag laying on the seat where Rick's buddy had
        been sitting. They'd left it behind.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I quickly called Rick. No answer. I texted him: "Hey, I think your buddy left his bag here." I grabbed the bag
        and waited.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        A few moments later, Rick walked back in with his friend. They were visibly relieved. Rick asked if there was
        some way they could repay me or give me a reward.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I was confused. A reward? For just letting him know they left a bag?
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        That's when Rick's friend explained: his life-saving medication was in that bag. Along with all his money.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I didn't find a bag. I found someone's lifeline.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Ever since that moment, Rick tried to move mountains for me the same way God had moved a mountain for me in that
        restaurant. The resistance I'd felt in our first conversation? Gone. The "we've always done it this way" mindset?
        Softened. Rick became one of my biggest supporters.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        God didn't just move the mountain. He chewed it up and spit it out.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">Festival of Light</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Over the next few months, Philip and I grew closer. We worked tirelessly together preparing for the Festival
        of Light—Concord's annual Christmas drama. Four months of planning, setup, rehearsals, tech runs, problem-solving.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        And then, finally, it was over. The event was a success. My schedule slowed down. I could breathe again.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">The STL Trip</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        One Thursday, Philip hit me up. "Hey, want to ride to St. Louis with me to pick up a sink for my Hillbilly
        Hydration camper?"
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Hillbilly Hydration. I had to know more.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Turns out, it's a mobile response unit for IV fluids. Philip and his wife are EMTs, nurses, and have been
        firefighters. They use the camper to provide emergency medical care at events, disaster relief, wherever it's
        needed.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        As we drove, we talked business ideas, ministry connections, life stories. And then I mentioned something
        that had been on my heart for years.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        "My step-dad was in a plane accident."
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Philip looked at me. "When?"
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        "About seven years ago."
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        He paused. Then asked, "Was this an old World War II plane?"
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        My heart stopped.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        "Yep."
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">The Connection</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Philip was there. He was one of the first responders to my step-dad's plane crash seven years earlier.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The man who stood up for me on my first day at Concord. The man who said he stayed because he heard I was coming.
        The man who became my friend and partner in ministry. That man had saved my step-dad's life seven years before
        we ever met.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        And neither of us knew it until that random Thursday drive to St. Louis.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        You can't tell me that's coincidence. You can't tell me that's random chance. You can't tell me God wasn't
        orchestrating every single detail of this story long before I ever walked into <a href="https://www.concordjc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-mcgennis-navy hover:text-mcgennis-gold transition-colors underline">Concord Baptist Church</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">The Mountain Mover</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        When I arrived at Concord, I saw a mountain. An impossible situation. A broken team. Resistance to change.
        Uncertainty everywhere.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        But God saw something different. He saw Philip, who would stand with me. He saw Rick, who would become my ally
        after a divine appointment at Hy-Vee. He saw connections that spanned seven years, crossing state lines and life
        events in ways I couldn't have imagined.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The Lord didn't just move that mountain. He took the mountain, chewed it up, and spit it out.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Because that's what God does. He doesn't just make a way. He orchestrates. He connects. He works behind the
        scenes in ways we won't understand until we're driving down the highway seven years later and suddenly realize
        He's been writing the story all along.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-xl font-medium text-gray-900">
        So when you face your mountain, remember: God doesn't just move mountains. He's already been working on your
        behalf in ways you won't see until you look back and realize it was never about the mountain at all.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-xl font-medium text-gray-900">
        It was always about the connections He was making. The people He was positioning. The story He was writing.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-xl font-medium text-gray-900">
        And that's worth more than moving any mountain.
