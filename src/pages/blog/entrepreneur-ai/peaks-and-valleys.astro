      <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-8 font-light">
        They say what goes up must come down. But nothing prepared me for how fast, or how far, I would fall.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">The Peak</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I was an early adopter of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/cryptocurrency-4427699" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-mcgennis-navy hover:text-mcgennis-gold transition-colors underline">cryptocurrency</a>, back when most people thought Bitcoin was just internet magic money
        that would disappear overnight. While they were skeptical, I was fascinated. I dove deep into the technology,
        the whitepapers, the communities. I wasn't just throwing darts at a board—I was studying, learning, and
        understanding what I was investing in.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Altcoins were my focus. I traded carefully, strategically. Some bets paid off small. Others paid off big.
        Really big. The portfolio grew from thousands to tens of thousands, then hundreds of thousands. And then,
        one day, I logged in and saw a number that didn't seem real:
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-center text-2xl font-bold text-mcgennis-navy">
        $9,000,000
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Nine million dollars. Life-changing money. Generational wealth. At that moment, I felt like I had figured it all out.
        I was going to cash out, secure my family's future, maybe start some businesses, give generously. The American dream
        was sitting right there in my account.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">The Valley</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I clicked the withdrawal button. That's all it should have taken. Move the money from the exchange to my bank account.
        Simple. Routine. Except the page wouldn't load.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I refreshed. Nothing. I cleared my cache. Nothing. I tried a different browser. My stomach started to sink.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Finally, the page loaded. But instead of my account dashboard, there was a banner across the top:
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 italic text-center">
        "Notice: This exchange has filed for bankruptcy. All assets are frozen pending investigation."
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The room spun. I read it again. And again. I searched for news. The headlines confirmed my worst nightmare:
        the exchange owner had taken the money and fled overseas. Millions of dollars from thousands of users. Gone.
        Including my $9 million.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I sat there, staring at the screen. Everything I had worked for, studied for, risked for—vanished in an instant.
        Not because I made a bad trade. Not because the market crashed. But because someone I trusted with my money
        decided to steal it and run.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">Rocket League and Reality</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I did what any rational person would do in that situation. I opened Rocket League and played ranked 2v2 until
        my hands hurt.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        There's something therapeutic about flipping cars around a digital soccer field when your real life feels like
        it's flipping upside down. For a few hours, my worries faded. The missed aerials, the perfectly timed demos,
        the communication with my teammate—it was a world where I had control. Where the rules made sense. Where effort
        equaled reward.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        But eventually, I had to log off. And when I did, the reality was still there. Nine million dollars. Gone.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">Meanwhile, God Had Other Plans</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Looking back now, I can see what I couldn't see then. God wasn't absent in that moment. He was right there,
        protecting me from something I didn't even know I needed protection from.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        What would I have done with $9 million at that stage of my life? Would it have drawn me closer to God, or
        further away? Would it have built character, or destroyed it? Would I have stayed hungry for purpose, or
        gotten comfortable with wealth?
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I'll never know for certain. But what I do know is that a few months later, something unexpected happened:
        I started an internship at the <a href="https://mobaptist.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-mcgennis-navy hover:text-mcgennis-gold transition-colors underline">Missouri Baptist Convention</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        If I had cashed out that $9 million, I never would have taken that internship. I wouldn't have needed it.
        But I did take it. And that decision changed everything.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        That internship led to five years of ministry work. Five years of learning servant leadership. Five years of
        using technology to serve churches and advance the Gospel. Five years that shaped who I am today—not just as
        an entrepreneur, but as a husband, father, and follower of Christ.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 tracking-tight">The Lesson</h2>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Life is full of peaks and valleys. Some of them we create. Others are created for us. And sometimes, what looks
        like the biggest loss of your life is actually God's greatest protection.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I don't have that $9 million. But I have something more valuable: a family I love, businesses I'm passionate about,
        a ministry that matters, and faith that's been tested and proven strong.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The valley taught me what the peak never could: that my worth isn't measured in my portfolio, and my purpose
        isn't determined by my net worth.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Would I have preferred to learn that lesson a different way? Absolutely. But I'm grateful I learned it when I did.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-xl font-medium text-gray-900">
        Because the peak might have made me rich. But the valley made me who I am.
